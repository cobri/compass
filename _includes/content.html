<p> 
I’m a second-year PhD student at Trinity College Dublin, focusing on the <b>genetics and epigenetics</b> of cancer.
I spend half my days at the bench, and half at the computer. 
Prior to this, I worked in a next-generation sequencing facility. 
I hold a BSc in <b>Neuroscience</b> from University College Cork and an MPhil in <b>Computational Biology</b> from the University of Cambridge.

<p>Outside of my research, I have a deep interest in journalism and travel, so I founded Trinity College Dublin’s International 
Affairs and Travel magazine. I’m also passionate about STEM outreach and I write about science for my university <a href="http://trinitynews.ie/author/carol-o-brien/">newspaper.</a>
